# No error conversion

I don't want try/catch error handling unless there is a specific reason (i.e. a library throws an error as part of the normal execution flow).  If a library can be configured so that it does not throw errors, but instead returns a special value for certain abnormal conditions, do so (i.e. axios and the status validation option)

# Don't use semicolons

Don't end statements with semicolons unless required by the Typescript parser.
